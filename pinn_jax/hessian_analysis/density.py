    Convolves the given eigenvalues with a Gaussian kernel, weighting the values
    by all_weights (or uniform weighting if all_weights is None). Example output
    can be seen in Figure 1 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10159.pdf. Visualizing
    the estimated density can be done by calling plt.plot(grids, density). There
    is likely not a best value of sigma_squared that works for all use cases,

      grids: Array of shape [grid_len], the smoothed spectrum will be plotted
        in the interval [grids[0], grids[-1]]. If None then grids will be
        computed based on max and min eigenvalues and grid length.
      grid_len: Integer specifying number of grid cells to use, only used if
